                <div class="about_team_description">
                    A mad passionate group of people working to inspire one nation at a time Bidyanondo (Learn for Fun) is an educational voluntary organization originating from Bangladesh. The official registration No. is S-12258/2015). Bidyanondo has been operated by 40 professionals, with help of thousands of volunteers. Our mission is to foster philanthropic works domestically and internationally. By designing innovative and inspiring programs, our goal is to engage students and
                    professionals to work together to educate, empower and lift the underprivileged. <br> One of our endeavours is to provide free education, educational materials and support. We have established libraries and a printing press for original publications. At times we arrange educational film showing, engage in innovative teaching techniques where the students learn through fun, games and songs. Our motto is to teach with compassion where a good human being is developed rather than a typical human who is only professionally equipped. Starting from volunteers, their children, refugees, street children and orphans, anyone with an
                    underprivileged background is welcome at our door.<br> Another highly successful project that we carried out is the One-taka-meal program. Here we let people come in and purchase a meal for only 1 taka/0.012 USD. This guarantees entitlement to food while feeling self reliance by purchasing with a minimum cost and at the same time having a decent, healthy meal with dignity. Under this program we also provide food for people under the age of 12 and over 60 years old people. This successful venture has inspired us to launch One-Taka-Bazaar where any item sold is just 1 taka/ 0.012 USD. Anyone who has a need can come into the shop just by paying 1 taka and we supplement the rest by crowdfunding.

                    Bidyanondo initially started as an organization serving the poor communities by making learning fun and engaging. Later by crowdfunding and by massive
                    support from the citizens of Bangladesh and International well wishers and donors we have grown into one of the biggest charities in Bangladesh. We have 6 orphanages, schools, libraries, printing press, Rohingya refugee shelters, shelters for domestic violence victims, shelters for new mothers and children who are outcast, garments and women empowerment endeavours where we train, educate and make them self sufficient. <br> We also recently launched the CMP-Bidyanondo Field Hospital dedicated to provide quality treatment, free of cost for the CoronaVirus treatment of distressed citizens. Another new hospital is also in the making to serve the underprivileged. Some of our localised projects are flood relief, educational assistance, free eatery, religious festivals celebrations for the poor, job training etc. We generally work with some of the most vulnerable demographics and specialize in disaster relief works. Our base is in Bangladesh, South America and in North America.

                <div class="about_team_description">
                    The founder of Bidyanondo is Mr. Kishor Kumar Das, a Peru based Corporate Professional. He is a social activist and coming from an underprivileged backdrop has seen first hand how much a person has to struggle and endure to meet the simplest of human rights like food, shelter and education. Withstanding all odds he made a successful career and dreamed of forming an institution where people will be treated with dignity and their basic needs will be met while giving them a way to be self-sufficient. To serve Bidyanondo better, Mr. Kishor eventually left his highly acclaimed profession and now invests his full time to carry it further. He initiates projects that solve complex problems with his uniqueness, effectiveness and originality. <br> Later a team of domestic and international members from
                    various backgrounds with varied skill sets came together and joined Bidyanondo. With their time, effort, intellect, skills, networks and financial support the charity thrived. The idea eventually took shape in the form of the currently running foundation, providing education, shelter, nutrition, healthcare & legal aid to the
                    impoverished and enabling them with skills, giving them the confidence to stand on the same pedestal as their peers. Bidyanondo started it's journey with just 22 students at Narayanganj in 22 December, 2013. <br> Currently it has eight branches nationwide with hundreds of volunteers, two orphanages in Ramu & Rajbari with 135 orphan child, one Old Age Home, One full Primary school on it's own land with 250 students, Two libraries with thousands of books open for all. Besides these, Bidyanondo has been conducted some unique and innovative programs such as One Taka Meal, One Taka Medical Aid, One Glass of Milk, Free academic coaching, Orphanage Center, Free University admission Coaching, Scholarship Program, Photography for children, Women Empowerment, Training Center etc. <br> Now 
                    Bidyanondo has reached a position where the name has become synonymous with trust and care. People donate here with ease and support wholeheartedly. The engaging and innovative endeavours launched in Bangladesh have become incredibly fruitful and now it has been replicated in branches across South America and North America.
